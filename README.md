My portfolio includes bio page, work page and contact information page.


Bio page shows my basic information and work page shows my github project. You could see my contact information in the contact information page.

Revision Narrative(06/05/2019):
1. Open external links (social media, github, projects, etc) in a new tab. 
2. Add a valid phone number 
3. Make email/phone number clickable using mailto and tel. 
4. Make Project screenshot unclickable. 
5. Remove "About me link" in nav bar.
I am unable to read your bio on mobile due to lack of contrast with background: https://cl.ly/a6ec40357804 and it's difficult on desktop: https://cl.ly/43aba96ee5eb. You should not have background text behind text that I need to read.
Spacing looks off on 320px screen (i.e. content is no longer centered). https://cl.ly/e17c6b1f6e27

What are the Webshop sections with latin at the bottom of your page? You should either put real content here or remove them.
Project section needs to include a description of the project and technologies used.
HTML should be mobile first, which means that mobile CSS doesn't need a media query, but is in the main CSS and you use media queries to override it for larger screens.
I'd like to see more of your passion for web development and desire to work on a team of great programers come through in your about me.
