Bio page shows my basic information and work page shows my github project. You could see my contact information in the contact information page.

Revision Narrative(06/05/2019):
1. Open external links (social media, github, projects, etc) in a new tab. 
2. Add a valid phone number 
3. Make email/phone number clickable using mailto and tel. 
4. Make Project screenshot unclickable. 
5. Remove "About me link" in nav bar.
6. Delete background image to make bio readable.
7. Put real content in the work section.
Project section needs to include a description of the project and technologies used.
HTML should be mobile first, which means that mobile CSS doesn't need a media query, but is in the main CSS and you use media queries to override it for larger screens.
I'd like to see more of your passion for web development and desire to work on a team of great programers come through in your about me.
